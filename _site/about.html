<p><strong>Dianoetic</strong> is a data and research consultancy dedicated to helping organisations turn complexity into clarity.<br />
We specialise in building systems, models, and strategies that are rigorous, human‑centred, and built to last — especially in resource‑constrained environments.</p>

<p>Our work is grounded in the belief that good data is not just about precision, but about purpose.<br />
Whether supporting policy design, program evaluation, or organisational infrastructure, we aim to deliver solutions that are technically sound, context‑aware, and genuinely useful.</p>

<p>We value:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarity over complication</strong> — making information accessible and actionable.</li>
  <li><strong>Design that respects reality</strong> — aligning systems with how teams actually work.</li>
  <li><strong>Impact that endures</strong> — creating tools and insights that remain relevant over time.</li>
</ul>

        <h1>Pooya Karambakhsh</h1>
        <h2>Economist · Data Strategist · Researcher</h2>
        <p>
          With over 12 years of cross‑disciplinary experience — and formal qualifications spanning engineering and social sciences — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pooya-karambakhsh"> Pooya</a> brings a rare blend of technical depth, analytical rigour, and human‑centred thinking to every project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holding degrees from leading institutions in Civil/Geotechnical Engineering (BSc, MSc) and Political Economy (GradCert, MA, PhD), he bridges the precision of engineering with the contextual insight of the social sciences. This dual perspective enables him to design systems that are not only technically robust but also grounded in the realities of people, policy, and place.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has built and optimised data ecosystems for national charities, universities, and advocacy organisations — delivering solutions that streamline operations, enhance reporting, and empower teams. His work includes CRM architecture, multi‑platform integration, data visualisation, and research frameworks tailored to real‑world constraints. Examples of his previous projects and affiliated initiatives, including Think Hammerly, can be explored on his <a href="pooya-karambakhsh.github.io">personal site</a>.
