<h2 id="pooya-karambakhsh--economist-data-strategist-researcher">Pooya Karambakhsh — Economist, Data Strategist, Researcher</h2>

<p>I founded <strong>Dianoetic</strong> to help organisations turn complex information into clear, actionable insight.<br />
With over <strong>12 years of cross‑disciplinary research</strong> and <strong>7+ years in data strategy and systems design</strong>, my work bridges economics, technology, and human‑centred problem‑solving.</p>

<p>I’ve built and optimised data ecosystems for <strong>public policy institutes, universities, and national non‑profits</strong>, delivering solutions that save time, cut costs, and improve decision‑making.<br />
From designing entire CRMs in Salesforce to integrating multi‑system workflows, my focus is always on <strong>clarity, efficiency, and impact</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-bring">What I Bring</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Economic Modelling &amp; Policy Analysis</strong> — Evidence‑based strategies for complex social and economic challenges.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Architecture &amp; Integration</strong> — Clean, future‑proof systems that work with your real‑world processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Research &amp; Evaluation</strong> — Rigorous, context‑aware analysis that informs strategy and drives change.</li>
  <li><strong>Capacity Building</strong> — Training, documentation, and tools that empower teams to own their data.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-crossdisciplinary-perspective">A Cross‑Disciplinary Perspective</h2>
<p>My career spans <strong>engineering, social sciences, and strategic consulting</strong>, giving me a rare ability to connect technical precision with big‑picture thinking.<br />
I’ve worked in contexts as varied as <strong>public housing research</strong>, <strong>post‑disaster program evaluation</strong>, and <strong>national advocacy campaigns</strong> — always with the same goal: to make data work for people.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="beyond-the-numbers">Beyond the Numbers</h2>
<p>I believe that the best solutions are <strong>both technically rigorous and human‑centred</strong>.<br />
That’s why I design systems and strategies that are not just functional, but also <strong>accessible, maintainable, and adaptable</strong> — especially in resource‑constrained environments.</p>
