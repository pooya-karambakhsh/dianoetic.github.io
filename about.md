# About Dianoetic

## Pooya Karambakhsh — Economist, Data Strategist, Researcher

I founded **Dianoetic** to help organisations turn complex information into clear, actionable insight.  
With over **12 years of cross‑disciplinary research** and **7+ years in data strategy and systems design**, my work bridges economics, technology, and human‑centred problem‑solving.

I’ve built and optimised data ecosystems for **public policy institutes, universities, and national non‑profits**, delivering solutions that save time, cut costs, and improve decision‑making.  
From designing entire CRMs in Salesforce to integrating multi‑system workflows, my focus is always on **clarity, efficiency, and impact**.

## What I Bring
- **Economic Modelling & Policy Analysis** — Evidence‑based strategies for complex social and economic challenges.
- **Data Architecture & Integration** — Clean, future‑proof systems that work with your real‑world processes.
- **Research & Evaluation** — Rigorous, context‑aware analysis that informs strategy and drives change.
- **Capacity Building** — Training, documentation, and tools that empower teams to own their data.

## A Cross‑Disciplinary Perspective
My career spans **engineering, social sciences, and strategic consulting**, giving me a rare ability to connect technical precision with big‑picture thinking.  
I’ve worked in contexts as varied as **public housing research**, **post‑disaster program evaluation**, and **national advocacy campaigns** — always with the same goal: to make data work for people.

## Beyond the Numbers
I believe that the best solutions are **both technically rigorous and human‑centred**.  
That’s why I design systems and strategies that are not just functional, but also **accessible, maintainable, and adaptable** — especially in resource‑constrained environments.
