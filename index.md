## Turning Data into Decisions

I’m Pooya Karambakhsh — economist, data strategist, and researcher — and I founded **Dianoetic** to help organisations turn complexity into clarity.

With over a decade of cross‑disciplinary experience in economics, data strategy, and systems design, I build solutions that are rigorous, human‑centred, and built to last. My work bridges technical precision with real‑world workflows, so your data doesn’t just exist — it works for you.

### What We Do
- **Economic Modelling & Forecasting** — Evidence‑based strategies for policy and investment.
- **Data Architecture & Integration** — Clean, future‑proof systems aligned with your processes.
- **Research & Analysis** — From design to delivery, tailored to your context.
